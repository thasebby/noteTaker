# Note Taker

## Description
The main reason for this project was being able to understand how to make GET and PULL routes when dealing with an HTML file and getting info from JSON files. 

## Installation
Installing most of what we have been using before which include path, express and fs. We had to figure out an NPM package that would give each note a unique ID so i used uniqid to create a 'Hexatridecimal ID.'

## Usage
This app was made to be a notetaker. Future developments will include figuring out how to delete the notes.
